Report Flycheck errors for a Magit Diff buffer.

Run ~M-x magit-diff-flycheck~ in a magit-diff buffer to display a
filtered list of Flycheck errors for the added/modified lines only.

This is primarily meant to be used on legacy projects where you do
not want to see errors for the whole file but only for the added/modified
lines.
